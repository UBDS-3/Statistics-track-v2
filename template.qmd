# Intro

Use this file as a template for your answers, copy this file to the lab you are working on, for example inside `labs/testings/`, and name it `answers.qmd`. Change all the tags in `<some text>` as well as lab name and author (in the beginning of the file) with your own.

The `quarto` files (the format you are currently working on) uses markdown, to know what markdown is see this quick guide: [link](https://commonmark.org/help/)

Additionally, `quarto` has code block to execute `R` code, like here:

```{r example}
# This is a comment
print("hello world!") # <- and this is the command
```

To add new block use `{r <name>}` part in the heading, where `<name>` is the name of the block, the block name should be unique.

Thats's it! Now look into the opened `html` file and do the tasks in the code blocks. Then run your code block to execute the commands and do the tasks.

# Template

Use this template to do your questions:

```{r}
# Put here required packages to load them, example:
# Use this code block only once in your file
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
```

## Task `<number>`

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

1. Put your question here

```{r <answer_number>}

# Put your code here

```

> Put your answer here

2. Put your next question if you have multiple questions...
